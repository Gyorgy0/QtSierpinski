Written in C++ this program allows the user to generate fractals until lvl 11 (Image size limit) at level 12 the program tries to generate a 20 480x20 480 but it fails, so to keep the program within safe bounds I set the maximum iteration count to 11.

The application can be downloaded using the installer or it can be directly compiled, using the source code in Qt Creator.
